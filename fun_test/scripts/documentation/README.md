## bugs_and_analyses

This is the location of
1. scripts used to reproduce a bug
2. scripts used to analyze functionality (repeated trials used to improve performance numbers)

### Guidelines
1. It is required to name the script after the bug say: em_753.py
2. If the software bug ID is not known ahead of time, please file an 'IN' task against yourself, so that the file-name would be something like: in_741.py
