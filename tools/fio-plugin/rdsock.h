 * Reliable Datagram API for funOS modules.  Allows for reliable exhange
 * of messages between two F1 nodes - a client and a server.  Ordering is
 * not guaranteed, but messages are typically received in the order sent.
 *
 * This API is currently implemented in a Posix environemnt only but could be
 * incorporated later into the FunOS network stack.  It enables development
 * of other FunOS modules (e.g. remote storage access) prior to the FunOS
 * network stack being available.
 *
 * Currently supports IPv4 addressing only.

 * managed by rdsock.  Upon completing the the use of the frame for
 * handling the message, the callee must send a completion WU to allow
